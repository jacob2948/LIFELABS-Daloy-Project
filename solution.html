							<h1>How Can We Solve Water Pollution</h1>

									<h2>Teaching People</h2>

										<p>We need campaigns to stop littering and save water. Communities can also organize clean-up drives to keep rivers and lakes clean.
										<article id="myArticle1" style="display: none;">
										
										<p>Water pollution is one of the biggest problems in our environment today. It affects people, animals, and even the food we eat. That is why we need to find ways to solve it, especially by teaching those in Agriculture and Fishery Arts.
										
										<p>Farmers and fishers play an important role in keeping our water clean. If farmers learn to use fewer chemicals and manage their waste properly, they can stop dirty water from going into rivers and lakes. Fishers can also help by practicing responsible fishing and taking care of the seas and ponds where they work. In schools, students in Agriculture and Fishery Arts can be taught about these good practices so they will know how to protect water when they grow up. By sharing knowledge and teaching people, we can prevent pollution and keep our water safe.</p>

										<p>Solving water pollution is not easy, but it is possible if we all work together. Teaching farmers, fishers, and students about the right ways to care for water is a big step toward a cleaner environment. If everyone does their part, we can make sure our rivers, lakes, and seas stay fresh and healthy for the future.</p>

									<h2>Reuse, Reduce, Recycle Campaign</h2>
									<div class="infos">
										<img src="images/solution-3Rs.jpg" alt="Img" height="175" width="780">
										<p>	Cut Plastics. Boost Recycling. Choose Nature‑Friendly Packaging. Protect Our Future.
										<article id="myArticle2" style="display: none;">

										<p>Another way to help solve this issue is by practicing the Reuse, Reduce, Recycle campaign and by cutting the use of plastics, especially in Agriculture and Fishery Arts.</p>
										
										<p>In agriculture, farmers can reduce water pollution by using fewer chemical fertilizers and pesticides. They can also reuse water through proper irrigation systems, making sure that water is not wasted and does not carry harmful chemicals into rivers and lakes. Recycling organic waste like crop residues into compost is another way to keep water clean. In fishery, fish farmers can reduce pollution by avoiding too much fish feed and chemicals in ponds. They can reuse materials like nets and containers instead of throwing them away, and recycle fish waste into fertilizer instead of dumping it into the water. Another important step is to cut plastics—farmers and fishers should avoid using plastic bags, bottles, and other single-use plastics that often end up in rivers and seas. By following these simple steps, farmers and fishers can protect our water while still doing their work.</p>

										<p>The Reuse, Reduce, Recycle campaign, together with cutting plastics, is a powerful way to fight water pollution. If people in Agriculture and Fishery Arts practice these methods, they can keep rivers, lakes, and seas clean. Through cooperation and care, we can keep our water sources clean.</p>
