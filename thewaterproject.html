   <p>Water is one of the most important resources on Earth. Every living thing from people to plants and animals—depends on clean water to survive. However, our water sources are now in 		danger because of pollution caused by human activities. Factories, farms, and even households produce waste that often ends up in rivers, lakes, and oceans. This project, 		The Water Project, aims to spread awareness about water pollution, how it affects our environment, and what we can do to protect and restore clean water for everyone, </p>
   	
	<h3 id="section_1">Why the Water Pollution</h3>
	<p> <b>Pollution</b> hurts not just our environment but all of us, when the air is polluted, and water turns dirty, 
		animals and humans suffering from environmental pollution. </br>

		Pollution also affects both Agriculture and Fishery Arts. When the air, soil, and water become polluted, it becomes harder for farmers to grow healthy crops and raise 			animals. Dirty water and harmful chemicals can damage plants and make the soil less fertile. In Fishery Arts, pollution harms fish and other sea animals because waste and 		plastics in rivers and oceans make the water unsafe. Fishermen lose their source of food and income, and people can get sick from eating contaminated seafood.
	
		<p> It is truly sad that our planet is suffering because of the waste we fail to dispose of properly. Seeing the Earth in pain reminds us to care for it more deeply to 		protect, clean, and keep it alive. Each of us has a part to play so that our planet doesn’t have to suffer anymore. <p>

	<h3 id="section_4">Meet D.A.L.O.Y </h3>
		<p>Welcome my name is DALOY – a proposed model project and alternative to clean and accessible water especially in rural areas. DALOY isn’t just a name, it stands for: <br>
		<h4>D - Daloy (Flow) </h4>  
		<h4>A - Alaga (Care) </h4>
		L - Linis (Cleanliness) <br>
		O - Oportunidad (Opportunity) <br>
		Y - Yaman (Resource) <br>

		<p>The group goal is simple: to ensure that every drop of water counts, every member of our community has access to it, and that we all take care of this water resources. 		Through education, innovation, and community action, DALOY flows not just in rivers and taps, but in the hearts of everyone who believes in a healthier, sustainable future. 		<br>

		Join us as we celebrate water, care for it, and turn it into an opportunity for growth and life for all. Because water is not just a resource – it’s DALOY. <br>
